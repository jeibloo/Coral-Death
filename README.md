# The Fast Death of the Shallow Reefs

### This small web app is to display the extent at which our planet's coral reefs are being bleached based on location. 

Are all the coral reefs getting bleached? Or is it just a few? If we were to pretend to find more in the future in nearby areas, would those also be bleached? Those are the questions I asked myself and answered using data from [Reefbase](http://www.reefbase.org/gis_maps/useofmaps.aspx).

Coral-Death is an persistent speculation app that shows the devastating dieout of our vital coral reefs. It's purpose is to try to educate as much as possible with known historical coral data and show how possibly devastated the coral reefs will be five years out.

Inspiration comes from reports that the Great Barrier Reef is dying a very quick death, the hotter the ocean the quicker the bleaching.
