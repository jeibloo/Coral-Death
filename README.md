# Fast Death of the Shallow Reefs

### This web app displays the extent at which our planet's coral reefs are being bleached. 

Are all the coral reefs getting bleached? Or is it just a few? If we were to pretend to find more in the future in nearby areas, would those also be bleached? Those are the questions I asked myself and answered using data from [Reefbase](http://www.reefbase.org/gis_maps/useofmaps.aspx).

Coral-Death is a speculation app that shows the devastating die-out of our vital coral reefs. Its purpose is to try to educate as much as possible with known historical coral data and show how damaged the coral reefs will be five years out.

Inspiration comes from reports that the Great Barrier Reef is dying a very quick death, the hotter the ocean the quicker the bleaching.
