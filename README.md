# The Fast Death of the Shallow Reefs

### This small web app is to display the extent at which our planet's coral reefs are being bleached based on location. 

Are all the coral reefs getting bleached? Or is it just a few? If we were to pretend to find more in the future in nearby areas, would those also be bleached? Those are the questions I asked myself and answered using data from [Reefbase](http://www.reefbase.org/gis_maps/useofmaps.aspx).

Inspiration comes from reports that the Great Barrier Reef is dying a very quick death, the hotter the ocean the quicker the bleaching.
